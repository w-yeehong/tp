## Project: Covigent

Covigent is a desktop application that is used to aid hotel staff handle the Covid-19 situation better. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

  * What it does: allows the user to allocate a patient to a room or remove a patient from a room.
